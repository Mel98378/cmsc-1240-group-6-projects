# cmsc-1240-group-6-projects
This repo is for all of our projects for CMSC 1240.
Projects will be organized into directories by name.

# Getting Started
Read the tutorial on how to use GitHub and GitHub Desktop below, then read the prompt under "Contact Information". 

# How to Contribute
This section is a step-by-step tutorial on how to make changes to projects on this repo. There are three sections: Setup, Making Changes, and Syncing Your Fork. Once you complete the Setup steps, you do not have to do them again. You should, however, be doing the steps from the latter two sections every time you make changes.

## Setup
Prerequisites: You must have a GitHub account, as well as having GitHub Desktop installed on your computer. 
Steps:
1.) On this page, create a Fork by using the "Fork" button at the top right of the page (all of you should already have this one done; the main project is lavender-aa/cmsc-1240-group-6-projects, but your copy should be called [your-github-username]/cmsc-1240-group-6-projects).
2.) On your fork of the project (see names above for how to check whose project you are on), click on the green "Code" button, and select "Open with GitHub Desktop". 
3.) Using GitHub Desktop, choose a file in your computer to store the project files (make sure you remember where this folder is, since it is important). 
After completing these steps, you should have a local copy of your fork downloaded onto your computer. This process is the same for any other public repository on GitHub, and you should only have to do it once per computer.

## Making Changes
Prerequisites: finished all steps in the Setup section
1.) Open any file from your local clone (the project files you copied in Setup step 3) in your text editor / IDE of choice (I use VS Code, but Dev-C++ should be able to and save individual *.cpp files as well).
2.) Make your changes; add new code, fix existing code, update information. This is the step where you edit the file to add your parts of the program. 
3.) Once you're done making changes, save your work.
4.) Open GitHub Desktop, and make sure that the top left dropdown says "cmsc-1240-group-6-projcets" under "Current repository"
5.) Review your changes: any files that you made changes to will appear on the main portions of the screen. Make sure that you only changed the file you were supposed to, and didn't add any new files. 
6.) Once you're done reviewing your changes, click on the top middle button labeled "Current branch", and click on "New branch" (the button right below "Pull requests" near the top). 
7.) Name the branch something relevant (for example, I might name one of my branches "Lavender's contributions"), click "Create branch", and select the option that says "Bring changes to the new branch". 
8.) After creating the new branch, add a summary (and, optionally, a description) of the changes that you made. As an example, I might put for the summary: "added battle system", and if there were specific things I wanted to note about it, I would put those in the description.
9.) Once you have made a summary (and maybe a description), push the button below that says "Commit to [your-branch-name]". 
10.) Press the button on the top right that says "Publish branch". 
11.) Press the button in the middle of the screen that says "Create Pull Request". You will be redirected to a website, with a title "Open a pull request". 
12.) Below the text field, press the green button that says "Create pull request". If there is an error that has something to do with merge conflicts, contact Lavender for help. 
13.) Wait for your pull request to be merged by Lavender.
If you followed all these steps properly, you should have an open pull request with your changes on it. If you get stuck or need help, contact Lavender. 

## Syncing Your Fork
Prerequisites: completed Setup
Every time you want to make new changes to the project, you should be making sure your copies of the project are up to date with the main project. Here are the steps to do that:
1.) Open GitHub Desktop, and make sure you are on the proper repo (Making Changes step 4).
2.) Press the "Fetch Origin" button on the top right. If you have uncommitted changes, you can commit them or stash them for later. 
3.) Click the "Current branch" dropdown, and select "Choose a branch to merge into main" at the bottom.
4.) Select "Upstream/main", and click "Create a merge commit".
