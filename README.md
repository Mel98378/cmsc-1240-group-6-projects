# cmsc-1240-group-6-projects
This repo is for all of our projects for CMSC 1240.
Projects will be organized into directories by name.

# How to Contribute
This section describes the steps involved in adding your portion of the code to the project.
## Prerequisites
You must have at least [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed, but I also reccommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (since it's easy/intuitive to use).
## Setting Up
- Fork the repository (button on the top right; this will make a copy of this repository which you can make edits to)
- Clone your fork to a local directory on your machine (using GitHub Desktop)
## Making Changes
- When adding anything to the codebase, create a new branch to develop on
- After making any changes or adding new files, commit your changes to the new branch you created in the previous step
- Once you have confirmed your commits are what you want, push your changes to your fork
- Going to your fork on the website, open a pull request to merge your new branch (with your changes) into the master branch of this repo

# Contact Information
To get familiar with using Git and GitHub/GitHub Desktop, please update this file (README.md) with your name and phone number.
